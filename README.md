this Battleship game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript provides an interactive and engaging experience for players, allowing them to strategize and compete against each other to sink their opponent's fleet of ships. The game board is represented by a grid consisting of rows and columns. The game interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game board is displayed using a grid layout, with each cell representing a position on the grid. The player's ships are displayed on their own grid, and their opponent's grid shows only the hits and misses. The game logic is implemented using JavaScript. It keeps track of the state of the game, including the positions of the ships, the shots taken, and the remaining ships. The logic validates the players' actions, such as selecting valid positions and ensuring ships are not placed outside the grid or overlapping. It determines the outcome of each shot, whether it's a hit or a miss, and updates the game state accordingly. The logic checks for the end of the game, determining the winner when all the ships of one player have been sunk.
